# TrajectoriesCompressionAnalysis

The proposed methodology assess how compression algorithms may influence the clustering analysis with respect to anomaly detection of vessel trajectories. Results shows that a suitable compression algorithm for a particular scenario can reduce the overall processing time with a low impact on the clustering outcome.
